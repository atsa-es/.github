## :fish: Overview

This is our organizational site for source code for our packages, our [r-universe repository](https://atsa-es.r-universe.dev/packages), online books, and teaching material for Applied Time Series Analysis for Fisheries and Environmental Sciences  ([website](https://atsa-es.github.io/)). We teach a 10-week course at the University of Washington during the spring quarters of odd-numbered years ([FISH 550](https://atsa-es.github.io/atsa/)), as well as various short courses that vary in length from a half-day to a week.
